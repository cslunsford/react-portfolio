                <p>Hello! My name is Christopher Lunsford and I am a 26 year old web-developer based out of Connecticut. I participated in a 24-week-long coding bootcamp where I learned both front-end and back-end development. I've become proficient in multiple technologies such as JavaScript, Node, SQL, MongoDB, React, and more!
