## Description
This webpage is a portfolio site that I made for myself. The purpose of the site is to give a brief description about me and my coding ability, display links to projects that I have worked on, and provide links to my GitHub and LinkedIn. The about me section on the homepage gives a short paragraph on my level of skill in coding and experience. The nav links in the site's header link to additional pages for viewing projects I have worked on, which languages I am proficient in, and a contact form. Links to my GitHub and LinkedIn can be found in the footer. This site was created using React and is styled using Boostrap and CSS.
